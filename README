Hey you !

So, you want a fully-configured website to display your wonderful photo albums ? Alright, here is what you need to do.

- Take PhotoShow and put it on your server (the archive)
- Uncompress the archive
- Rename the folder you got to whatever you want.
- Inside that folder, you'll see a "photos" folder. This is where your pictures are gonna go.

PhotoShow works with a "Projecs/Albums/photos" structure. This means that inside that "photos" folder, the Projects folders are stored. Then, in each Project folder, Albums folders are stored. And then, in each Album folder, you put the photos.

"Whaaaat ?"

Well, just try it : create inside "photos" :  "My_Project/My_album", and put a picture into My_album. 

Now, with your web browser, go to your server address. You should see on the top left "My Project". Click on it. you should see "My album" appear. Click on it. And now, your picture will appear.

Look at the Wiki : it should help with any question you have.
